Loops:-->

		Loops are facilitating to execute set of instrcution [Programming lines]
		repeatedly, to evalucate any particular condition to get true.
		
		Advantages:-->
		
				1. Reduce line of code
				2. Dynamic Iterations, To read multiple set of data


		1. for
		2. foreach
		3. while
		4. do-while
		
		
1. For:-->
